linux_inode_cheat_sheet:
  definition: "In Linux, an inode is a data structure used to store metadata about a file or directory. Each file has a unique inode containing information like permissions, ownership, and file type. Running out of inodes may prevent creating new files or directories, even if there is available disk space."

        Replace '/dev/sdXN' with the appropriate device name."
