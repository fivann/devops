Identify the Target to Use to Determine if the Network Is Online

List the contents of /usr/lib/systemd/system/network*:

ls /usr/lib/systemd/system/network*
We'll see a number of targets we might be able to use. Among them, network-online.target seems like the best bet.

Run the following:

man 7 systemd.special
Search for network-online.target in the man page by typing:

/network-online
We'll see there's an entry about the network-online.target as well, and that looks like the right thing.

Press q to get back to the command prompt.

Write the Custom Service File

Change directory:

cd /etc/systemd/system

Create custom.service:

vim custom.service

Enter the following:

[Unit]
Description=Custom Service
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/bin/emacs --daemon
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval "(kill-emacs)"

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
Save and exit the file by pressing Escape followed by :wq.

Start the service:

systemctl start custom.service
Check its status:

systemctl status custom.service
We should see it's running.


Additional Resources
Note: Please give the lab server time to finish provisioning before attempting a connection via ssh.

You've been tasked with writing a service file for a piece of software called emacs.

The command to start it is:

emacs --daemon
The command to stop it is:

emacsclient --eval "(kill-emacs)"
The emacs software will fork a process and then exit.

The software should not start until the network is online.

Working with Systemd Mount Units
In this hands-on lab, we will create systemd mount and automount units. We will create the two new mount units on our host.

The first mount unit should comply with the following:
    File system:/dev/xvdg1
    Mounted on /mnt/data
    Filesystem: xfs
    Description: "Data mount"
    Should be wanted by the multi-user.target

The second mount should comply with the following:
    File system: /dev/xvdg2
    Mounted on /mnt/backup
    Filesystem:ext4
    Mounted as read-only.
    Description: "Backup mount"
    Should be wanted by the multi-user.target.

The file system should comply with the following:
    Automatically mounted using an automount unit
    An idle timeout of 10 minutes
    Description: "Automount backup directory‚Äù
    Should be wanted by the multi-user.target.

Note:
    Creat all unit files in /etc/systemd/system
    The UUIDs of the filesystems will change with each attempt

Before We Begin

To get started, we need to log in to our Linux server using the provided credentials. Make sure to become the root user once logged in.

Create a Unit File for the Data Mount
Create a unit file for the data mount based on the information provided in the instructions and ensure that it is started and enabled:

First, we need to change our directory to the system directory using cd /etc/systemd/system.
Run lsblk -f to obtain the UUID for xvdg1 xfs for use in the file.
Create a unit file in /etc/systemd/system named mnt-data.mount. For our example, we're using vim:
vim mnt-data.mount
Enter the following into the file:
[Unit]
Description=Data mount

[Mount]
What=/dev/disk/by-uuid/Filesystem_UUID
Where=/mnt/data
Type=xfs
Options=defaults

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Save and quit with :wq.
Update the systemd manager configuration to include the new unit file:
systemctl daemon-reload

Start and enable the mnt-data.mount unit:
systemctl enable mnt-data.mount --now

Create a Unit File for the Backup Mount
Create a unit file for the backup mount:

Create a mountpoint for mnt-backup.mount at /mnt/backup:
mkdir /mnt/backup

Use lsblk -f and coppy the UUID for xvdg2 ext4 for the mnt-backup.mount file.
Create a unit file in /etc/systemd/system named mnt-backup.mount using vim: vim mnt-backup.mount
Enter the following contents:
[Unit]
Description=Backup mount

[Mount]
What=/dev/disk/by-uuid/Filesystem_UUID
Where=/mnt/backup
Type=ext4
Options=ro

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Save and quit.
Update the systemd manager configuration to include a new unit file:
systemctl daemon-reload

Create an Automount Unit File
Create an automount unit file for mnt-backup.mount based on the information provided:

Create a unit file in /etc/systemd/system named mnt-backup.automount using vim: vim mnt-backup.automount.
Enter the following contents:
[Unit]
Description=Automount backup directory

[Automount]
Where=/mnt/backup
TimeoutIdleSec=600

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Save and quit.
Update the systemd manager configuration to include the new unit file:
systemctl daemon-reload

Start and enable the mnt-backup.automount unit:
systemctl enable mnt-backup.automount --now

Check that the status is running:
systemctl status mnt-backup.automount
Conclusion
Congratulations! You've completed the lab!
