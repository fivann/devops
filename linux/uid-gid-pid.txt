In Linux, there are several predefined UID/GID/PID ranges that are reserved for specific purposes. 
Here are some common ones:

UIDs:
0: The root user
1-999: Reserved for system accounts and daemons
1000-65534: Normal user accounts

GIDs:
0: The root group
1-999: Reserved for system groups
1000-65534: Normal user groups

PIDs:
0: The swapper process (which is part of the kernel)
1: The init process
2: The kthreadd process (which manages kernel threads)
3-4: Used by the ksoftirqd and events workqueues
5: Used by the kworker process (which manages kernel worker threads)
6: The migration thread
7: The rcu_sched process (which handles RCU callbacks)
8: The rcu_bh process (which handles RCU callbacks in bottom halves)
9: The watchdog process
10: The watchdog/0 process (which monitors system activity)
11: The events/0 process (which manages system events)
12: The khelper process (which provides kernel-level helper functions)
13: The kworker/u<cpu> process (which manages per-CPU kernel worker threads)
14: The kworker/0:1 process (which manages a separate pool of kernel worker threads)
15: The kdevtmpfs process (which manages device nodes for devtmpfs filesystems)

Note that these ranges may vary depending on the Linux distribution and version.
