ext2:
- Introduced in 1993 as the default filesystem for Linux.
- Supports up to 2 terabytes of disk space.
- Does not support journaling, which means that filesystem checks are required after unexpected shutdowns.
- Uses a traditional block-based allocation scheme.

ext3:
- Introduced in 2001 as an extension of ext2 with journaling support.
- Supports up to 32 terabytes of disk space.
- Journaling helps improve recovery after unexpected shutdowns.
- Uses a traditional block-based allocation scheme.

ext4:
- Introduced in 2008 as an extension of ext3 with improved performance and scalability.
- Supports up to 1 exabyte of disk space.
- Supports extents, which reduces fragmentation and improves performance.
- Supports delayed allocation, which improves performance by delaying allocation of blocks until they are actually needed.

XFS:
- Introduced in 1994 by Silicon Graphics for their IRIX operating system.
- Supports up to 8 exabytes of disk space.
- Uses a more advanced extent-based allocation scheme that reduces fragmentation and improves performance.
- Supports journaling for improved recovery after unexpected shutdowns.

Btrfs:
- Introduced in 2009 as a new filesystem for Linux with advanced features.
- Supports up to 16 exabytes of disk space.
- Uses a copy-on-write (CoW) allocation scheme that allows for snapshots and other advanced features.
- Supports transparent compression and encryption.

ZFS:
- Developed by Sun Microsystems for their Solaris operating system.
- Supports up to 256 quadrillion zettabytes of disk space.
- Uses a combined file system and volume manager that provides advanced features such as snapshots, data compression, and data deduplication.
- Supports transactional copy-on-write allocation that provides strong data consistency guarantees.
