#################

In this Makefile, we define the name of the binary (BINARY_NAME) and the source files for the binary (SOURCE_FILES). 
The build rule for the binary concatenates the source files into a single file, sets the executable bit 
on the resulting file using chmod, and renames the file to the desired binary name.

To use this Makefile, you would simply run make in the directory containing the Makefile and the source files. 
This will build the binary according to the rules specified in the Makefile. To clean up, you can run make clean, which will remove the binary.

Note that this method simply concatenates the source files into a single file, 
so it may not work for more complex scripts with multiple dependencies. 
In general, it's better to compile code written in a compiled language like C or C++ to create a binary, rather than using a shell script.
