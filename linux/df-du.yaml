df:
  description: Displays the amount of disk space used and available on file systems
  options:

    - -T: show file system type
    - -t <type>: show only file systems of a specific type
    - -x <type>: exclude file systems of a specific type
  example: df -h

du:
  description: Displays the amount of disk space used by files and directories
  options:
    - -h: show sizes in human-readable format
    - -s: display only a total for each argument
    - -c: display a grand total for all arguments
    - --exclude=<pattern>: exclude files that match a pattern
  example: du -h



# The main difference between df and du is that df shows the amount of disk space used and available on file systems, 
# while du shows the amount of disk space used by files and directories. df displays information on the file system as a whole, 
# while du focuses on individual files and directories within the file system.

# Another key difference is that df reports on the total size of a file system and how much of that space is free, 
# whereas du reports on the size of individual files and directories. This means that df is more useful 
# for determining how much free space is available on a particular file system, while du is better for 
# identifying which files and directories are taking up the most space on a file system.

# In summary, df is used to display information about file systems, while du is used to display information 
# about individual files and directories.
