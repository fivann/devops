linux_permissions_on_links:
  definition: |
    "In Linux, hard links share the same inode as the target file, 
    meaning they have the same permissions and ownership. 
    However, symbolic links have their own set of permissions, 
    which refers to the permissions of the link itself and not the target file. 
    When accessing a symlink, the system checks the permissions on the target file, not the symlink."
