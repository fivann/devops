swap:
  description: Swap space is used as virtual memory when the system runs out of physical RAM. The swap file/partition is used to temporarily store data that is not currently being used in memory.
  example:
    - Create a swap partition:
      ```
      /dev/sda2  swap  swap  defaults  0  0
      ```
    - Create a swap file:
      ```
      /mnt/swapfile  none  swap  sw  0  0
      ```
  options:
    - `device`: The device or partition that will be used as swap.
    - `swap_type`: Indicates that the device is being used as swap space.
    - `swap_options`: Options to be used when mounting the device as swap.
    - `dump`: Specifies whether the swap space should be backed up with the dump command.
    - `fsck`: Specifies the order in which filesystem checks should be performed.

swapon:
  description: Activates swap space on a device or file.
  example:
    - Activate a swap partition:
      ```
      sudo swapon /dev/sda2
      ```
    - Activate a swap file:
      ```
      sudo swapon /mnt/swapfile
      ```
  options:
    - `-a, --all`: Activate all swap devices listed in /etc/fstab.
    - `-d, --discard`: Enable discard option when activating swap.
    - `-e, --ifexists`: Silently ignore devices that do not exist.
    - `-p, --priority`: Specify the priority of the swap device.

mount_and_format_swap:
  description: Mounts a new block device and formats it to swap space.
  example:
    - Mount and format a new block device as swap:
      ```
      sudo mkswap /dev/sdb1
      sudo swapon /dev/sdb1
      ```
  steps:
    - Identify the new block device using a tool like `lsblk` or `fdisk`.
    - Create a swap partition using a tool like `fdisk` or `parted`.
    - Format the new partition as swap using the `mkswap` command.
    - Activate the new swap space using the `swapon` command.

mkswap:
  description: Formats a block device or file as swap space.
  example:
    - Format a block device as swap:
      ```
      sudo mkswap /dev/sdb1
      ```
    - Format a file as swap:
      ```
      sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/swapfile bs=1G count=4
      sudo chmod 600 /mnt/swapfile
      sudo mkswap /mnt/swapfile
      ```
  options:
    - `-L, --label`: Set a label for the swap space.
    - `-U, --uuid`: Set a UUID for the swap space.
