Linux systemctl targets are predefined sets of systemd units that are used to define different system states or levels. 
When a target is activated, all units that are listed under that target are started. Each target is designed to provide 
a specific system configuration and functionality, such as basic system initialization, multi-user mode, 
graphical user interface, rescue mode, and emergency mode.

Targets are an important feature of the systemd init system, which is the default init system used by many 
modern Linux distributions. Targets are defined in unit files that are stored in the 
/usr/lib/systemd/system and /etc/systemd/system directories.

Systemctl targets can be used to manage and control the state of a Linux system, for example, 
by changing the default target or switching to a different target to perform specific tasks or operations. 
The systemctl command can be used to list available targets, check the current target, and switch to a different target.

For example, to list available targets on a Linux system, you can use the following command:

systemctl list-units --type target
To switch to the graphical target, you can use the following command:

systemctl isolate graphical.target
To switch to the rescue target, you can use the following command:

systemctl rescue
In summary, systemctl targets provide a way to define different system states or levels and manage the state 
of a Linux system by activating a specific set of systemd units.
