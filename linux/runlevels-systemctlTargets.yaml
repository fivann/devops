Linux systemctl targets are predefined sets of systemd units that are used to define different system states or levels. 
When a target is activated, all units that are listed under that target are started. Each target is designed to provide 
a specific system configuration and functionality, such as basic system initialization, multi-user mode, 
graphical user interface, rescue mode, and emergency mode.

Targets are an important feature of the systemd init system, which is the default init system used by many 
modern Linux distributions. Targets are defined in unit files that are stored in the 
/usr/lib/systemd/system and /etc/systemd/system directories.

Systemctl targets can be used to manage and control the state of a Linux system, for example, 
by changing the default target or switching to a different target to perform specific tasks or operations. 
The systemctl command can be used to list available targets, check the current target, and switch to a different target.

For example, to list available targets on a Linux system, you can use the following command:

systemctl list-units --type target
To switch to the graphical target, you can use the following command:

systemctl isolate graphical.target
To switch to the rescue target, you can use the following command:

systemctl rescue
In summary, systemctl targets provide a way to define different system states or levels and manage the state 
of a Linux system by activating a specific set of systemd units.

Here are some use cases of Linux systemctl targets with command examples:

Changing the default target
You can change the default target that is activated when the system boots by using the systemctl set-default command 
followed by the name of the target. For example, to set the default target to the graphical target, you can use the following command:

sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target

Listing available targets
You can list all available targets on the system by using the systemctl list-units command with the --type=target option. For example:

systemctl list-units --type=target
This will list all available targets on the system.

Checking the current target
You can check the current target that is active on the system by using the systemctl get-default command. For example:

systemctl get-default
This will show the name of the current default target.

Switching to a specific target
You can switch to a specific target by using the systemctl isolate command followed by the name of the target. For example, 
to switch to the multi-user target, you can use the following command:

sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target
This will activate the multi-user target and stop all services that are not required for multi-user mode.

Restarting the system in rescue mode
You can restart the system in rescue mode by using the systemctl rescue command. This will activate the rescue target and start only essential services that are needed to troubleshoot and repair the system. For example:

sudo systemctl rescue
This will restart the system in rescue mode.

Activating emergency mode
You can activate emergency mode by using the systemctl emergency command. This will activate the emergency target and start only a minimal set of services that are needed to debug and recover the system in case of severe problems. For example:

sudo systemctl emergency
This will activate emergency mode. Note that you should use emergency mode with caution and only if you know what you are doing, as it may result in data loss or system damage if not used properly.
