The Ansible inventory is a file or group of files that contains a list of the hosts or nodes that Ansible will manage. 
The inventory file can be in either an INI or YAML format. Here is an example of an inventory file in INI format:

[webservers]
webserver1.example.com
webserver2.example.com
webserver3.example.com

[databases]
dbserver1.example.com
dbserver2.example.com

[all:vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu

In this example, we have defined two groups of servers: webservers and databases. 
The webservers group contains three hosts, while the databases group contains two hosts. 
We have also defined a variable in the [all:vars] section that sets the ansible_user variable to ubuntu. This variable will be inherited by all hosts in the inventory file.

We can also define groups of groups by placing a : between the group names. 
For example, we can define a group of all servers by using the all keyword:

[all:children]
webservers
databases

This will create a group called all that contains all hosts in the webservers and databases groups.

We can also define variables for individual hosts or groups by using the [group:vars] or [host:vars] sections. For example:

[databases:vars]
db_user=myuser
db_password=mypassword

[webserver1.example.com:vars]
nginx_version=1.18

In this example, we have defined the db_user and db_password variables for the databases group, 
and the nginx_version variable for the webserver1.example.com host.

If there is no server in your inventory file that matches the webserver1.example.com 
hostname and nginx_version=1.18 variable, then Ansible will simply skip any tasks that are targeted at that specific host or variable.

In other words, Ansible will only run tasks on hosts that match the inventory criteria. 
If there are no hosts that match a certain criteria, then Ansible will skip those tasks.

This can be useful if you have a large inventory file with many hosts, and you want 
to run specific tasks only on certain hosts or groups of hosts. You can use the inventory 
file to define the hosts and groups that match your criteria, and Ansible will automatically skip any hosts or groups that do not match.

If you want to ensure that a certain task is run on all hosts, regardless of whether they 
match a certain criteria or not, you can use the all group in your playbook. For example:

yaml

- name: Install nginx
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
    
In this example, the hosts: all line specifies that the apt task should be run on all hosts 
in the inventory file, regardless of whether they match any specific criteria or not.
