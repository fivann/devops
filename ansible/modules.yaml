# Ansible provides a wide range of modules that can be used to manage various aspects of system administration. 
# Here are some of the main Ansible modules with examples of their usage:

# apt: This module is used to manage packages on Debian or Ubuntu based systems. For example:


- name: Install nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    
# This will ensure that the nginx package is installed on the target system.

# yum: This module is used to manage packages on Red Hat or CentOS based systems. For example:

- name: Install Apache
  yum:
    name: httpd
    state: present
    
# This will ensure that the httpd package (Apache) is installed on the target system.

# service: This module is used to manage system services. For example:

- name: Ensure Apache is running
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: started
    
# This will ensure that the httpd service (Apache) is running on the target system.

# file: This module is used to manage files and directories on the target system. For example:

- name: Create a directory
  file:
    path: /path/to/directory
    state: directory
    
# This will create the /path/to/directory directory on the target system.

# copy: This module is used to copy files from the Ansible control node to the target system. For example:

- name: Copy a file to the target system
  copy:
    src: /path/to/local/file
    dest: /path/to/remote/file
    
# This will copy the /path/to/local/file file from the Ansible control node to the /path/to/remote/file path on the target system.

# template: This module is used to copy files from the Ansible control node to the target system, 
# while performing variable substitution on the file contents. For example:

- name: Copy a template file to the target system
  template:
    src: /path/to/template.j2
    dest: /path/to/remote/file
    vars:
      variable_name: variable_value
      
# This will copy the /path/to/template.j2 file from the Ansible control node to the /path/to/remote/file path 
# on the target system, while performing variable substitution on the file contents using the variable_name and variable_value values.

# lineinfile: This module is used to edit text files on the target system by adding, removing or replacing specific lines. For example:

- name: Add a line to a file
  lineinfile:
    path: /path/to/file
    line: 'new_line_to_add'
    
# This will add the new_line_to_add line to the /path/to/file file on the target system.

# These are just a few examples of the many Ansible modules that are available. 
# By combining these and other modules, you can build complex automation tasks and manage your systems efficiently.
