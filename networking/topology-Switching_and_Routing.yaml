Network_topologies:
  Bus:
    Description: "All devices are connected to a central cable (bus) with two endpoints"
    Advantages:
      - Easy_to_implement
      - Low_cost
    Disadvantages:
      - Limited_distance_and_number_of_devices
      - Single_point_of_failure
    Example:
      Devices: [A, B, C, D]
      Topology: "A---B---C---D"

  Star:
    Description: "All devices are connected to a central device, like a hub or switch"
    Advantages:
      - Easy_to_add_or_remove_devices
      - Centralized_management
      - No_single_point_of_failure
    Disadvantages:
      - Higher_cost_due_to_central_device
    Example:
      Devices: [A, B, C, D]
      Topology: |
        A
         \
          H---C
         /
        B
         \
          D

  Ring:
    Description: "Devices are connected in a circular manner, with each device connected to two others"
    Advantages:
      - Simple_wiring
      - Can_handle_higher_traffic_than_bus_topology
    Disadvantages:
      - Difficult_to_add_or_remove_devices
      - Single_point_of_failure
    Example:
      Devices: [A, B, C, D]
      Topology: "A---B---C---D---A (circular)"

  Mesh:
    Description: "Each device is connected to every other device in the network"
    Advantages:
      - High_redundancy
      - Robust_against_failures
    Disadvantages:
      - High_cost_due_to_large_number_of_connections
    Example:
      Devices: [A, B, C, D]
      Topology: |
        A---B
        |\  |
        | \ |
        |  \|
        C---D

  Hybrid:
    Description: "A combination of two or more topologies"
    Advantages:
      - Flexible_design
      - Can_be_customized_to_meet_specific_needs
    Disadvantages:
      - Complex_wiring_and_management
    Example:
      Devices: [A, B, C, D, E, F]
      Topology: |
        A---B---C (bus topology)
          |
          H (central device of a star topology)
          |
        D---E---F (bus topology)

Switching_and_Routing:
  Switching:
    Description: "Switches forward packets within a local network, operating at Layer 2 of the OSI model"
    Function: "Using MAC addresses, switches learn which devices are connected to their ports and create an internal table to forward packets to the correct destination"
    Advantages:
      - Efficient_packet_forwarding
      - Reduces_collision_domains
    Example:
      Network_Diagram: |
        A---|
            S---C
        B---|
      Explanation: "Switch 'S' forwards packets between devices A, B, and C based on their MAC addresses"

  Routing:
    Description: "Routers forward packets between different networks, operating at Layer 3 of the OSI model"
    Function: "Routers use IP addresses and routing tables to determine the best path for forwarding packets between networks"
    Advantages:
      - Connects_different_networks
      - Reduces_broadcast_domains
      - Supports_different_media_and_topologies
    Example:
      Network_Diagram: |
        A---|
            R---C
        B---|
      Explanation: "Router 'R' forwards packets between devices A, B, and C, which are on different networks, based on their IP addresses"
