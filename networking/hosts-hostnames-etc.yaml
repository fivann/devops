- Explanation:
    - '/etc/hosts': 'A configuration file that maps hostnames to IP addresses'
    - 'hostnames': 'Human-readable labels assigned to devices connected to a computer network'
    - '/etc/hostname': 'Contains the hostname of the system'
    - 'hostnamectl': 'A command used to view and set the system hostname'
- Example:
    - '/etc/hosts':
      - IP: '127.0.0.1'
        Hostname: 'localhost'
      - IP: '192.168.1.100'
        Hostname: 'example-host'
- Commands:
    - ViewHostname: 'hostname'
    - SetHostname: 'hostnamectl set-hostname new-hostname'
    - EditHostsFile: 'sudo nano /etc/hosts'
- AddMapping:
    - IP: '192.168.1.101'
      Hostname: 'new-host'

- DIFFERENCE: |
  /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts are two different configuration files in Linux systems with distinct purposes:
  
  /etc/hostname: This file contains the hostname of the local system. 
  The hostname is a human-readable label assigned to a device connected to a computer network, 
  used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication. 
  The /etc/hostname file usually contains a single line with the system's hostname. When the system boots, 
  the hostname is set based on the contents of this file.
  
  /etc/hosts: This file is used for mapping hostnames to IP addresses. 
  It provides a local, static method for resolving hostnames to their respective IP addresses, 
  which can be useful in situations when no DNS service is available. 
  The /etc/hosts file contains a list of IP addresses and their corresponding hostnames, with one mapping per line. 
  This file is used by the operating system to perform hostname lookups when needed.
  In summary, /etc/hostname defines the hostname of the local system, while /etc/hosts is responsible 
  for mapping hostnames to IP addresses.
