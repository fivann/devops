OSI Model Troubleshooting:

Layer 1: Physical Layer
- Check for cable connectivity and physical damage.
  - Use the command 'ipconfig' (Windows) or 'ifconfig' (Linux/Mac) to check network interface status.
  - Use the command 'ping' to test connectivity between devices.
  - Use the command 'netsh interface show interface' (Windows) or 'ip link show' (Linux/Mac) to view interface settings.
  - Use a cable tester to check for cable faults.

Layer 2: Data Link Layer
- Check for MAC address conflicts or errors.
  - Use the command 'arp -a' to check the ARP table and verify MAC addresses.
  - Use the command 'netstat -nr' to check routing table entries.
  - Use the command 'ifconfig' (Linux/Mac) or 'ipconfig /all' (Windows) to view interface settings.
  - Use a protocol analyzer such as Wireshark to inspect frames.

Layer 3: Network Layer
- Check for IP address conflicts or routing issues.
  - Use the command 'ipconfig' (Windows) or 'ifconfig' (Linux/Mac) to check IP configurations.
  - Use the command 'ping' to test connectivity between devices.
  - Use the command 'tracert' or 'traceroute' to check routing paths.
  - Use the command 'route print' (Windows) or 'netstat -r' (Linux/Mac) to view routing table entries.

Layer 4: Transport Layer
- Check for port conflicts or firewall issues.
  - Use the command 'netstat -ano' to check for open ports and associated processes.
  - Use the command 'telnet' to test port connectivity.
  - Use the command 'nc' to test TCP/UDP ports.
  - Use the command 'iptables -L' (Linux) or 'netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all' (Windows) to view firewall rules.

Layer 5: Session Layer
- Check for session establishment issues.
  - Use the command 'telnet' or 'ssh' to test session establishment.
  - Use the command 'netstat -a' to check for established sessions.
  - Use the command 'ipconfig /flushdns' (Windows) or 'systemd-resolve --flush-caches' (Linux) to clear DNS cache.

Layer 6: Presentation Layer
- Check for data formatting issues.
  - Use a protocol analyzer such as Wireshark to inspect packet contents.
  - Use the command 'openssl s_client -connect host:port' to test SSL/TLS connections.
  - Use the command 'curl -v host:port' to test HTTP/HTTPS connections.

Layer 7: Application Layer
- Check for application-specific issues.
  - Use application-specific debugging tools or logs to identify issues.
  - Use the command 'nslookup' to test DNS resolution.
  - Use the command 'dig' to test DNS resolution and zone transfers.
  - Use the command 'ping -a' to resolve IP addresses to hostnames.

  Layer_5_Session:
    Description: "Manages and controls connections between applications"
    Real_life_example: "A user connecting to an online game server, where the session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates the connection between the user's game client and the game server"
  Layer_4_Transport:
    Description: "Ensures reliable data transmission between devices"
    Real_life_example: "Sending an email using the SMTP protocol, where the transport layer ensures the email data is reliably transmitted from the sender's email client to the recipient's email server"
  Layer_3_Network:

Ping:
  Description: "A utility used to test network connectivity and measure round-trip time between devices"
  Protocol: "ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)"
  OSI_Layers:
    - Layer_3_Network:
        Description: "Ping operates at the network layer because it uses the ICMP protocol, which is part of the IP suite"
        Function: "Ping sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the target device and waits for ICMP Echo Reply packets in response"
    - Layer_4_Transport:
        Description: "Although Ping primarily operates at the network layer, it indirectly involves the transport layer"
        Function: "ICMP messages are encapsulated within IP datagrams, which are then transported using either TCP or UDP"
  Example: "A user pinging a website's IP address to test connectivity and measure the round-trip time for packets"
