  description: >
    arping is a command-line utility for sending ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
    requests and receiving ARP replies. It is useful for discovering hosts on a local network,
    checking for duplicate IP addresses, and measuring network latency.

        flag: -I
        description: Specify the network interface to use for sending ARP requests.
    - count:
        flag: -c
        description: Send a specific number of ARP requests.
    - interval:
        flag: -i
        description: Set the interval in seconds between sending ARP requests.
    - timeout:
        flag: -w
        description: Set the timeout in seconds to wait for an ARP reply.
    - quiet:
