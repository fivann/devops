  definition: | 
    "NIC bonding and teaming are methods to combine multiple network interfaces on a single host 
    to provide increased bandwidth, fault tolerance, and load balancing. 
    Bonding uses a single logical interface for multiple physical interfaces, 
    while teaming allows for more flexible and advanced configurations."
