OSI_Model:
  Layer_7_Application:
    Description: "Provides end-user services and interfaces for network communication"
    Real_life_example: "A user accessing a website using a web browser, which communicates with a web server using the HTTP protocol"
  Layer_6_Presentation:
    Description: "Translates data between network formats and application-specific formats"
    Real_life_example: "Converting data from a file, such as a .jpg image, into a format that can be transmitted over a network"
  Layer_5_Session:
    Description: "Manages and controls connections between applications"
    Real_life_example: "A user connecting to an online game server, where the session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates the connection between the user's game client and the game server"
  Layer_4_Transport:
    Description: "Ensures reliable data transmission between devices"
    Real_life_example: "Sending an email using the SMTP protocol, where the transport layer ensures the email data is reliably transmitted from the sender's email client to the recipient's email server"
  Layer_3_Network:
    Description: "Determines the best path for data transmission between networks"
    Real_life_example: "A user in the United States accessing a website hosted on a server in Europe, where the network layer routes the user's request through multiple networks and routers to reach the destination server"
  Layer_2_Data_Link:
    Description: "Provides a reliable link between devices on the same network"
    Real_life_example: "A laptop connected to a Wi-Fi access point, where the data link layer ensures reliable communication between the laptop's Wi-Fi adapter and the access point"
  Layer_1_Physical:
    Description: "Defines the physical characteristics of a network, such as cables, connectors, and signaling"
    Real_life_example: "A network technician connecting a computer to a switch using an Ethernet cable, where the physical layer defines the properties of the cable, connectors, and electrical signals"

Ping:
  Description: "A utility used to test network connectivity and measure round-trip time between devices"
  Protocol: "ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)"
  OSI_Layers:
    - Layer_3_Network:
        Description: "Ping operates at the network layer because it uses the ICMP protocol, which is part of the IP suite"
        Function: "Ping sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the target device and waits for ICMP Echo Reply packets in response"
    - Layer_4_Transport:
        Description: "Although Ping primarily operates at the network layer, it indirectly involves the transport layer"
        Function: "ICMP messages are encapsulated within IP datagrams, which are then transported using either TCP or UDP"
  Example: "A user pinging a website's IP address to test connectivity and measure the round-trip time for packets"
