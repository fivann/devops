To serve the /opt/web/sample.html file using Nginx, you can follow these steps:

Open the Nginx configuration file located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf in a text editor.
In the http section of the configuration file, add a new server block:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com; # replace with your server name
    root /opt/web;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /sample.html;
    }
}

In this example, we are telling Nginx to listen on port 80 and serve requests for example.com. 
The root directive specifies the root directory for the website, which in this case is /opt/web.

The location block specifies how to handle requests for the website. The try_files directive tells Nginx to try to serve the requested file, and if it doesn't exist, try to serve the file with the name sample.html.

Save the configuration file and restart Nginx:

sudo systemctl restart nginx

After completing these steps, Nginx will serve the sample.html file when a user visits the website. 
Note that you may need to adjust the permissions of the /opt/web directory to allow Nginx to access the files. 
Additionally, you may need to configure your DNS or hosts file to point example.com to the IP address of your server.

If your server only has an IP address, you can use the IP address as the server_name in the Nginx configuration. For example:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 192.0.2.123; # replace with your server IP address
    root /opt/web;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /sample.html;
    }
}

In this example, we're telling Nginx to listen on port 80 and serve requests for the IP address 192.0.2.123. 
The root directive specifies the root directory for the website, which in this case is /opt/web.

The location block specifies how to handle requests for the website. 
The try_files directive tells Nginx to try to serve the requested file, and if it doesn't exist, try to serve the file with the name sample.html.

After you've saved the configuration file and restarted Nginx, you can access the sample.html file 
by visiting http://192.0.2.123/ in a web browser. Note that you may need to open port 80 in your server's 
firewall to allow incoming traffic to Nginx.
