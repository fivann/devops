GUIDE


$ git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
$ cd docker-bench-security

Using superuser permissions execute the docker-bench-security.sh 
shell script and redirect standard output to a file called /tmp/bench1.out

$ sudo sh docker-bench-security.sh > /tmp/bench1.out

*The sudo command will prompt your for the cloud_user password
NOTE: At this point, you may get warnings or errors.
This is ok, and expected, as the checks are always being updated, please proceed to check the output file created from this command.
Use the more command to look at the first part of the docker bench output:

$ more /tmp/bench1.out

Use the auditctl command to list any auditing rules that are already setup on the system:

$ sudo auditctl -l

Use the auditctl command to add a rule to audit the /var/lib/docker directory:

$ sudo auditctl -w /var/lib/docker -k "docker lib"

Now run the docker bench utility again and direct output to /tmp/bench2.out:

$ sudo sh docker-bench-security.sh > /tmp/bench2.out

Now use the Linux diff command to compare the output from the first run in bench1.out to the second run in bench2.out:

$ diff /tmp/bench1.out /tmp/bench2.out


There are various tools available to check for vulnerabilities in a Dockerfile. 
Here are a few options:

Docker Bench Security: Docker Bench Security is a popular open-source tool that automates 
the process of checking for common security issues in Docker containers. 
It also provides guidance on how to fix any vulnerabilities that are found.

Clair: Clair is an open-source vulnerability scanner for containers. 
It analyzes Docker images and provides a list of vulnerabilities that can be sorted by severity. 
It also integrates with Docker registry and Kubernetes.

Anchore: Anchore is an open-source tool for analyzing container images for vulnerabilities. 
It can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan your Docker images for security issues.

Trivy: Trivy is an open-source vulnerability scanner that specializes in scanning container images. 
It can detect vulnerabilities in both the operating system and application dependencies.

To use any of these tools, you'll need to build your Docker image and then scan it using the tool of your choice. 
For example, with Docker Bench Security, you can run:


docker run --rm -it \
    --name dockerbenchsecurity \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    docker/docker-bench-security
    
This command will run Docker Bench Security against your Docker installation and report any vulnerabilities that are found. 
Similarly, for Clair, Anchore, and Trivy, you'll need to run a command that points to your Docker image and scans it for vulnerabilities.

It's important to note that while these tools can help you identify vulnerabilities in your Docker images, they are not foolproof. 
It's still important to follow best practices for secure Dockerfile creation and use reputable base images and libraries 
to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
