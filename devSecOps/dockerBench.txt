GUIDE


$ git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
$ cd docker-bench-security

Using superuser permissions execute the docker-bench-security.sh 
shell script and redirect standard output to a file called /tmp/bench1.out

$ sudo sh docker-bench-security.sh > /tmp/bench1.out

*The sudo command will prompt your for the cloud_user password
NOTE: At this point, you may get warnings or errors.
This is ok, and expected, as the checks are always being updated, please proceed to check the output file created from this command.
Use the more command to look at the first part of the docker bench output:

$ more /tmp/bench1.out

Use the auditctl command to list any auditing rules that are already setup on the system:

$ sudo auditctl -l

Use the auditctl command to add a rule to audit the /var/lib/docker directory:

$ sudo auditctl -w /var/lib/docker -k "docker lib"

Now run the docker bench utility again and direct output to /tmp/bench2.out:

$ sudo sh docker-bench-security.sh > /tmp/bench2.out

Now use the Linux diff command to compare the output from the first run in bench1.out to the second run in bench2.out:

$ diff /tmp/bench1.out /tmp/bench2.out
