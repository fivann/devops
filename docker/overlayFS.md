A layered file system is a type of file system that uses a layered approach to storing and accessing files. Each layer represents a set of changes to the file system, and these layers can be stacked on top of each other to create a complete view of the file system.

The layers in a layered file system can be read-only or read-write, and they can be shared across multiple users or processes. Each layer can contain different types of files, such as directories, symbolic links, device files, and regular files.

When a file is accessed or modified, the layered file system will look for the file in the uppermost layer first. If the file is not found in that layer, the file system will look in the next lower layer, and so on, until the file is found or the search reaches the bottom layer.

The content of a layered file system will vary depending on the specific implementation, but some common features of layered file systems include:

Base layer: This is the bottom-most layer in the file system, and it typically contains the core operating system files and libraries. This layer is usually read-only and shared across all users and processes.

User layer: This layer is added on top of the base layer, and it contains files that are specific to individual users or processes. This layer is usually read-write and can be modified by the user or process that owns it.

Application layer: This layer is added on top of the user layer, and it contains files that are specific to an application or software package. This layer is also usually read-write and can be modified by the application or software package that owns it.

Some examples of layered file systems include the OverlayFS file system used by Docker, the Device Mapper Thin Provisioning system used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and the Union file system used by FreeBSD.

Layered file systems have many advantages, including the ability to create lightweight and efficient virtual environments, the ability to share file system resources across multiple users and processes, and the ability to easily create backups and snapshots of file systems.
