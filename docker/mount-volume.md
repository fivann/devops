In Docker, VOLUME and MOUNT are two different mechanisms for handling data storage and management.

### VOLUME 
creates a new, empty data volume within a container. When you create a container with a VOLUME instruction, Docker will automatically create a new directory in the container's filesystem to store the data. Any data written to this directory will be persisted even if the container is removed or replaced. Here's an example:
```
FROM my-image
VOLUME /var/lib/myapp/data
```
In this example, the Dockerfile specifies that a new data volume should be created at /var/lib/myapp/data within the container. Any data written to this directory will be persisted even if the container is stopped, removed, or replaced.

On the other hand, 
### MOUNT
allows you to mount a directory or file from the host machine into the container. This means that data stored in the mounted directory will be accessible from both the host machine and the container, and any changes made to the data will be reflected in both places. Here's an example:

``` docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container my-image ```

In this example, we're running a container from the my-image image and mounting the directory /path/on/host from the host machine to /path/in/container within the container. This means that any files in /path/on/host will be accessible from within the container, and any changes made to those files will be reflected on the host machine as well.

So to summarize, VOLUME creates a new data volume within the container's filesystem, while MOUNT allows you to mount a directory or file from the host machine into the container. Use VOLUME for persistent data storage within the container, and use MOUNT for sharing data between the host machine and the container.



```docker volume create [VOLUME_NAME]```: This command creates a new volume. For example, to create a volume called mydata, you would run docker volume create mydata.

```docker volume ls```: This command lists all of the volumes that have been created on your system.

```docker volume inspect [VOLUME_NAME]```: This command displays detailed information about a specific volume. For example, to view information about the mydata volume, you would run docker volume inspect mydata.

```docker volume rm [VOLUME_NAME]```: This command removes a volume. For example, to remove the mydata volume, you would run docker volume rm mydata.

```docker run -v [VOLUME_NAME]:[CONTAINER_PATH] [IMAGE_NAME]```: This command mounts a volume into a container. For example, to mount the mydata volume into a container at the path /app/data, you would run ```docker run -v mydata:/app/data myimage```.

```docker run --rm -v [VOLUME_NAME]:[CONTAINER_PATH] [IMAGE_NAME]```: This command mounts a volume into a container and removes the container when it stops running. This is useful for running one-off tasks. For example, to run a one-off task in a container with the mydata volume mounted at /app/data, you would run ```docker run --rm -v mydata:/app/data myimage mycommand```.

```docker run -v [HOST_PATH]:[CONTAINER_PATH] [IMAGE_NAME]```: This command mounts a directory or file from the host machine into a container. For example, to mount the directory /path/on/host from the host machine into a container at the path /app/data, you would run ```docker run -v /path/on/host:/app/data myimage```.

```docker run --mount type=bind,source=[HOST_PATH],target=[CONTAINER_PATH] [IMAGE_NAME]```: This command mounts a directory or file from the host machine into a container using the ```--mount``` flag. For example, to mount the directory /path/on/host from the host machine into a container at the path /app/data, you would run ```docker run --mount type=bind,source=/path/on/host,target=/app/data myimage```.

By using these commands, you can easily manage volumes in Docker, create and remove volumes as needed, and mount them into containers to persist data even if the container is removed or recreated.



```Volume mount```: This type of mount creates a volume in Docker and mounts it to the container. Volumes are managed by Docker and can be shared among multiple containers. The data in the volume persists even if the container is deleted. Here is an example of a volume mount:
```
docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container myimage
```
This command mounts the directory /path/on/host from the host machine to /path/in/container in the container.

```Bind mount```: This type of mount mounts a file or directory from the host machine to the container. The data is not managed by Docker and does not persist if the container is deleted. Here is an example of a bind mount:
```
docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container:ro myimage
```
This command mounts the directory /path/on/host from the host machine to /path/in/container in the container in read-only mode.

```tmpfs mount```: This type of mount creates a temporary file system in memory and mounts it to the container. The data in the tmpfs is lost when the container is deleted. Here is an example of a tmpfs mount:
```
docker run --mount type=tmpfs,destination=/path/in/container myimage
```
This command creates a tmpfs file system at /path/in/container in the container.

```Named pipe mount```: This type of mount allows you to mount a named pipe (FIFO) from the host machine to the container. Here is an example of a named pipe mount:
```
docker run --mount type=npipe,source=\\.\pipe\mypipe,target=/path/in/container myimage
```
This command mounts the named pipe mypipe from the host machine to /path/in/container in the container.
