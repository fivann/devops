In Docker, VOLUME and MOUNT are two different mechanisms for handling data storage and management.

### VOLUME 
creates a new, empty data volume within a container. When you create a container with a VOLUME instruction, Docker will automatically create a new directory in the container's filesystem to store the data. Any data written to this directory will be persisted even if the container is removed or replaced. Here's an example:
```
FROM my-image
VOLUME /var/lib/myapp/data
```
In this example, the Dockerfile specifies that a new data volume should be created at /var/lib/myapp/data within the container. Any data written to this directory will be persisted even if the container is stopped, removed, or replaced.

On the other hand, 
### MOUNT
allows you to mount a directory or file from the host machine into the container. This means that data stored in the mounted directory will be accessible from both the host machine and the container, and any changes made to the data will be reflected in both places. Here's an example:

``` docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container my-image ```

In this example, we're running a container from the my-image image and mounting the directory /path/on/host from the host machine to /path/in/container within the container. This means that any files in /path/on/host will be accessible from within the container, and any changes made to those files will be reflected on the host machine as well.

So to summarize, VOLUME creates a new data volume within the container's filesystem, while MOUNT allows you to mount a directory or file from the host machine into the container. Use VOLUME for persistent data storage within the container, and use MOUNT for sharing data between the host machine and the container.
